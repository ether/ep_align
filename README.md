# What is this?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply Text Alignment in a pad.  Currently supports:

* Left
* Center
* Justify
* Right

# Export support
Experimental.  As attributes are line by line on Etherpad some weirdness may be experienced.

# History
I decided to copy/pasta the ep_headings2 plugin over ep_align to fix a load of issues.

# License
Apache 2

# Development
Development done for free to help support continued learning due to distruption by the corona virus.  26LLC supported.
